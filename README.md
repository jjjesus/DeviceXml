Device XML
=====

This C# project is an example of using the Model-View-ViewModel
pattern for a graphical user interface (GUI) based on Windows
Presentation Foundation (WPF).

The Model objects are loaded from XML files that are embedded
as resources in the executable.

The C# Language Integrated Query (LINQ) facility is used
throughout for parsing the XML and querying collections.
